This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error involving unexpected NaN results when using undefined instead of null in a function designed to handle null values. The bug.js file contains the erroneous code, while bugSolution.js provides the corrected version. The issue arises from the implicit type coercion of undefined in arithmetic operations, which differs from the explicit null check.
